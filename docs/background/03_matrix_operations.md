# Matrix of Operations

No, we are not talking about math. We have a matrix of ideas to test.

## Rewriters

The rewriter uses a generative language model to rewrite the text. This is the same as a prompt, but we are using it to rewrite the text instead of generate it.

The main two areas to test:

- Different models for the generator/rewriter.
- Different instruction prompts for the above. These will likely be paired.

## Data Embeddings

We convert text into embeddings and use that for similarity search.

There are two main areas to test:

- Different pre-processing methods of the text to embed. We will call this a text rewriter.
- Different models for embedding (conversion of text to a vector).

## Query Embeddings

We need to lookup data based on the query.

- We will use the same embedding model as the data embeddings
- Different pre-processing methods of the query to embed. We will call this a query rewriter. This does not need to use the same generative model as the data rewriter, though it likely would.

## Reranking

We need to re-rank the results based on the query.

## Storage and Retrieval

We can start with these options:

- [ ] SQLite VSS
- [ ] PostgreSQL pgvector
- [ ] usearch

## Filtering

We need combine and filter the results.

## Ranking

We need combine and rank the results.

## Prompting

We need to prompt the LLM with the retrieved data in a smart manner. Different approaches may get different results for each LLM, and we need to be able to compare them.

## Testing

We need to test a matrix of choices:
(models for embedding) x (instructions for data and query embedding) x (LLM models for the instructions) x (filtering) x (ranking) x (prompting) x (LLM models for the Q&A).
